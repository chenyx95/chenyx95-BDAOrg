My name is Yuxi Chen. I am a master's student in Applied Statistics, graduating this May. 

Recently, an interesting website -- *NYC Open data* attracted my attention. This website offers a bunch of official New York City's data in various categories, and people are welcomed to work on these data sets and share their insights. I found the *real-time traffic speed data* which contains real-time traffic information captured by special sensors installed throughout the city:

["Real-Time Traffic Speed Data" (produced by NYCDOT)](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Transportation/Real-Time-Traffic-Speed-Data/qkm5-nuaq)

It would be really cool to produce a tool for optimizing daily commute in the city by analyzing this very large data set. The following image shows a small portion of the data:
